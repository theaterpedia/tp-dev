This monorepo implements a layered nuxt-architecture as described by Kruti Patel on: https://github.com/Krutie/nuxt-layers-playground/
- for detailled explanations watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWXRiBQw_lE
- docs on nuxt-layers/extends: https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers  and   https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/layers

The repo is changed from pnpm (didn't work for me) to lerna (with nx) through yarn 1.22.19 on node 20,
successfully running these commands:
```yarn```
```yarn clean```
```yarn dev```

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses yarn as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages


- `docs_demo`: a [VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) app
- `ui_demo`: a stub Nuxt component library with [Histoire](https://histoire.dev/)
- `config_demo`: `eslint` configuration (using [@antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config))
- `tsconfig_demo`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting

### Setup

To install all dependencies, run the following command:

```
yarn
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

### Lint

To check & fix linter through all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn lint
yarn lint:fix
```

### Test

To run tests through all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn test
```

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
yarn build
```

### Generate: SSG

To statically generate this project:

```
yarn generate
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.org/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
yarn dlx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
yarn dlx turbo link
```

Use a custom remote cache server [turbo-remote-cache](https://github.com/ducktors/turborepo-remote-cache)
